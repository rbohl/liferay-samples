  "Located on the earth-facing portion of the moon, The Lunar Resort is the solar system's only moon-based resort accessible from earth. The famous and luxurious Lunar Shuttle is the only way to get to the resort. In addition to 3-night minimum stays, the resort offers first time human visitors a great introduction to space travel, and for enterprising guests, inter-galactic pilot licensing opportunities. It goes without saying that many unique lunar adventures await.\n\nSome of the Resort's distinguished visitors include earth's famous trio of Bri(y)ans--Brian Chan, Brian Kim, and Bryan Cheung. We've also hosted former Plutian Prime Minister Plebius Pluranimus! We?ve been featured in several magazines and broadcast shows, too.", \
